Literally meaning pictures run riot this narrative art form has crossed over into other forms of cultural expression, including cosplay dressing up. Contemporary manga and digital anime are linked to their historic roots as Manga gives us a chance to see the origins of modern Japanese cartoons and  spoiler alert  theyre older than you think. The Handscrolls of Frolicking Animals (Choju giga), for example, dating back to 1200 AD, is considered by some to be the foundation of modern manga. Showing bestselling books from the 1970s, anime and gaming, the exhibition shows how manga has become a multimedia global phenomenon.",
