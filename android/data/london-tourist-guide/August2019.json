		"description": "A recreation of the oldest surviving manga bookshop in Tokyo comes to the British Museum as it stages the largest exhibition of manga ever to take place outside of Japan. Literally meaning pictures run riot this narrative art form has crossed over into other forms of cultural expression, including cosplay dressing up. Contemporary manga and digital anime are linked to their historic roots as Manga gives us a chance to see the origins of modern Japanese cartoons and  spoiler alert  theyre older than you think. The Handscrolls of Frolicking Animals (Choju giga), for example, dating back to 1200 AD, is considered by some to be the foundation of modern manga. Showing bestselling books from the 1970s, anime and gaming, the exhibition shows how manga has become a multimedia global phenomenon.",

		"description": "The Notting Hill Carnival was originally a local affair for west Londons homesick Caribbean community and been held since 1966, this has evolved into Europes biggest street party. The carnival sets London on fire in a blaze of Caribbean spirit as extravagantly costumed dancers, calypso and soca musicians and steel bands are joined by over a million revellers of all ages. Sunday is officially childrens day, but there are loads of kids on both days enjoying the bright colours of the floats and the dancers' feathered costumes. Adults can shake their booty at dozens of stages and there are tunes for all tastes at over 30 static sound systems, from house to hip-hop. It's a huge area and can get very crowded, so be prepared for an exhausting day out, but for anyone who loves a party, carnival remains the absolute highlight of the London summer.",

See the nineteen State Rooms which are still used by the Royal Family to receive and entertain guests on state and ceremonial occasions. Decorated in lavish fashion, they include paintings by Rembrandt, Rubens and Canaletto, Sevres porcelain and some of the finest English and French furniture in the world. There are also some exquisite royal gifts, including Faberge Eggs, on display. This is a fascinating opportunity to admire the taste - often wonderful, sometimes comically bad - of Britain's monarchy.",
